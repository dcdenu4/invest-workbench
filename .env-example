# Nothing here is required, but it's sometimes useful in development
# to customize the linkage to the python side of this application
# by defining custom paths to the invest and server executeables.

# USAGE: Create a `.env` file in the project root that looks similar to this
# one. This file is loaded by main.js if it is launched in dev mode. 

# Use-case 1. PyInstaller-built invest binaries in some custom location.
# Add extensions, such as ".exe" if on Windows.
INVEST="build/invest/invest"
SERVER="build/invest/server"

# Use-case 2. Paths to executeables in a python environment
# This is useful when actively developing `server.py` because it 
# avoids the need to build binaries with PyInstaller. Note, this time
# we also need a path to python executeable.
#PYTHON="env/bin/python"
#SERVER="src/server.py"
#INVEST="env/bin/invest"


# Set the desired port number for the local flask server
PORT=5000
